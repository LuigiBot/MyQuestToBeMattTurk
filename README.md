# MyQuestToBeMattTurk

This is based on a personal project based on Summoning Salt's "Quest to beat Matt Turk".
As seen in the video, TAS (Tool Asssisted Speedruns) were developed in order to figure out the theoretical bests for each fight.

However, there were times that the speedrunners beat the TAS by finding a better strategy.

# Proposal

Develop a neural network that, based on the controller inputs (will try to do it with human possible combinations) and the states of the game, can create the best route (Be Matt Turk) for every fighter.

# Notes

Penalization for time spent in the fight.
Reward for beating the fight.
Extremely small penalty for the number of commands (to find the most efficient route).

# TODOs

Will commit here the emulators and try to document it as best as I can.
